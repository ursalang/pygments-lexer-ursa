# Pygments lexer for Ursa programming language

Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  

This is a lexer for the [Ursa programming language](https://ursalang.github.io)
for use with the syntax highlighter [Pygments](https://pygments.org).

It is distributed under a BSD license.

I hope it will soon be part of the Pygments distribution.


## Usage

To run Pygments on an Ursa file, assuming you have Pygments installed:

```
$ pygmentize -x -l /PATH/TO/ursa.py FILE.ursa
```
